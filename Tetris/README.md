# Tetris
Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage Tetris licensing.[wikipedia]
This is my second project using pygame and it was so fun to do :)
You can easily play this one in your computer if you have pygame installed on your device.
If your are a mac user, due to MacOS incompatibilities with pygame, you should try the pygame 2.0.0.dev8 version or higher on your laptop.
