## Conway's game of life
Game of life is a cellular automation created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
This life simulates the life of some cells based on three simple rules:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.


A sample for the simulation on a 64 by 64 board.
